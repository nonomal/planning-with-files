## [2.4.0] - 2026-01-17 (Anthropic Patterns)

### Added

- **Session Management Features (Anthropic Patterns)** (Closes #19)
  - Implemented key patterns from Anthropic's article "Effective harnesses for long-running agents".
  - This provides a more robust, verifiable, and recoverable workflow for multi-session tasks.

- **Enhanced Session Initialization (`init-session.sh`, `init-session.ps1`)**
  - New scripts to start or resume a session.
  - Runs a verification checklist on startup (planning files exist, git status clean).
  - Displays current project status (phase, branch, last commit).
  - Logs session start to `progress.md`.
  - Replaces the old `session-catchup.py` with a more integrated workflow.

- **Pass/Fail Status Tracking in `task_plan.md`**
  - Template updated with a `Phase Summary` table.
  - Phases now use status icons: ⏸️ Pending, 🔄 In Progress, ✅ Pass, ❌ Fail, ⏭️ Skipped.
  - Each phase includes a `Test Results` table to prevent premature completion.
  - Directly inspired by Anthropic's feature list JSON format.

- **Git Checkpoint Workflow & Documentation**
  - New `docs/git-checkpoints.md` documents the "one phase, one commit" pattern.
  - `task_plan.md` template now includes a `Git Checkpoints` table to log commit hashes.
  - Formalizes using git commits as reliable rollback points.

### Changed

- **Workflow:** The recommended workflow now centers around `init-session.sh` and git checkpoints, replacing the previous manual session recovery process.
- **Templates:** `task_plan.md` has been significantly updated to support the new verification and checkpointing features.
- **Documentation:** `README.md` and `SKILL.md` updated to reflect the new session management workflow.

### Thanks

- @wqh17101 for raising the initial issue (#19) and providing the link to the Anthropic article that inspired these changes.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed

### Thanks

Special thanks to:
- @aimasteracc for Kilo Code support and PowerShell script contribution (PR #30)
- @mtuwei for reporting Windows compatibility issues (#32)
- All community members who tested and provided feedback

  - Root cause: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to repo root, but templates were only in subfolders

  - Now templates are accessible regardless of how `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` resolves
  - Works for both plugin installs and manual installs

### Structure

After this fix, templates exist in THREE locations for maximum compatibility:
- `templates/` - At repo root (for `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/`)
- `planning-with-files/templates/` - For plugin marketplace installs
- `skills/planning-with-files/templates/` - For legacy `~/.claude/skills/` installs

### Workaround for Existing Users

If you still experience issues after updating:
1. Uninstall: `/plugin uninstall planning-with-files@planning-with-files`
2. Reinstall: `/plugin marketplace add OthmanAdi/planning-with-files`
3. Install: `/plugin install planning-with-files@planning-with-files`
